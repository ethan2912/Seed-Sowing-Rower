# Seed-Sowing-Rower-with Android Application-ESP8266 NODE MCU 

It is Seed Sowing Rower Controled by Application 

In the present scenario most of the countries do not have sufficient skilled man power in agricultural sector and that affects the growth of developing countries. Therefore, farmers have to use upgraded technology for cultivation activity (seed sowing, fertilizing, spraying etc.). So, it’s a time to automate the sector to overcome this problem which in turn will also eliminate the requirement of Labors and also avoid the wastage of seeds.
1. Automation in “Seed sowing” and other features of Agricultural activities.
2. Reduce the manpower which is required to seed plantation process in farming.
3. with help of technology to improve the Accuracy of seed plantation process in farming.


OBJECTIVES:

1. Automation in seed plantation on farms
2. Access of rowers from all over the world
3. Large area of farm covered with efficient work.
4. Plantation of seed with proper environment

Components :

1. Battery:
The Battery is used to provide 12V power supply. It will be provided to Node Mcu and Arduino Uno
2. Node-Mcu Esp8266:
It is Microcontroller Unit. It is used to provide some important features of microcontrollers such as GPIO, PWM, ADC. So, it will be used to provide connectivity and app control to the rower with remote control feature.
3. Seed hopper:
Seed hopper is used to simply drop the seed. The tap will be controlled to ON and OFF by the app.
4. 12V motor:
The wheels are attached to the motors after getting the signal from the node Mcu it will controlled by the app. When a rower turns in left the speed of left wheel is more than the right and the when it turn to the right the speed of left wheel is more.
5. App:
All over system is controlled through the app, moment of the rower such as Right, left, forward and back.
ON and OFF of hopper is also controlled by the app.
6. Arduino Uno:
Ardunio Uno is used to take the reading of moisture sensor.
7. Servo Motor:
Servo motor is used to controller position of Moisture sensor
8. Moisture Sensor:
It detect the moisture and Moisture detector send data to UNO.
